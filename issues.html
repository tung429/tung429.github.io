              <h4 class="">Lacking charging devices</h4>
              <p class="">“I already experimented 5 times of calling tow truck service because my car run out of battery in the past 3 years.” Said Mr. Ng, an electric cars driver as well. “The government is actually rolling out some charging devices on on-street parking spaces for quick battery supplement ” Mr. Wong Kam-sing, GBS, JP, Secretary for the Environment. According to the budget plan last year, the government have set aside $120million for increasing over 1000 public chargers and charging devices on on-street parking spaces in the next 3 years. However, based on a Legislative Council document, as on-street parking spaces only have limited space and electricity supply, therefore the authorities still evaluating the accessibility on it. </p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class="">Stephen Cheung, Digital Energy Efficiency and Smart Solutions Business Director in Schneider Electric, the electric cars charging devices distribution and usage are ineffective and inefficient. Bases on the data that we found, 62% of the chargers stations in Hong Kong are standard charge or middle charge type which takes approximately 7-8 hours and 3-4 hours respectively for a car to be fully charged; quick charge type takes less than an hour. The slow circulation will occupy the space for a longer time causing inefficiency and further worsen the problem of charger inadequacy. Stephen Cheung suggests that there are limitations in altering existing charger facilities to fulfil the demand. However, a technology “Load Sharing” can be a solution: Say charger facility can originally provide 10 parking spaces to be fully charged at the same time with 100% electricity. When the owner does not need the car to be fully charged, the freed-up electricity can provide room to install more charging equipment beyond the original ten parking spaces.<br><br><br>“The government's policy is that car owners should charge their vehicles daily in their residences, offices or other appropriate places; public charging networks are mainly auxiliary facilities, and they are not and cannot replace daily charging facilities.”, said Mr Wong Kam-sing, GBS, JP, Secretary for the Environment .Therefore, the existing charging facilities are mainly disturbed in business and commercial district, causing inconvenience to user who want to charge overnight after a day of car usage and those who do not live close/ usually go to the districts will have to travel far for charging.<br><br>&nbsp;However, Legislative Council member Tanya Chan said, “There are many obstacles involved in promoting charging stations in private housing estates, such as who is responsible for construction costs, connecting cables to charging stations or passing through non-public places, which can easily cause opposition from non-electric vehicle owners.”</p>

          <h4 class="">Unappropriated usage&nbsp;</h4>
          <p class="">“Parking spaces of electric vehicle chargers are often occupied by non-electric vehicles, making it even harder for me to search for a space to park”, said Mr. Kwok, an electric vehicle user. According to Office of Ombudsman, electric vehicle chargers in government parking lot are always occupied by non-electric vehicles or charged vehicles. Government said parking space with charger are reserved for electric vehicles, but there’s no laws and regulations to force its execution ── parking spaces with charging facilities cannot be reserved for electric vehicles but prioritised only. Parking spaces with charging facilities usually locate on lower floor of car parks, non-electric vehicles drivers will park their cars in the spaces for convenience. “Some hotels have set up charging stations at the highest level of the parking lot, the authorities should take advantage of this.”, Chan Han-pan Chairman of Panel on Transport said.</p>

          <h4 class="">The Future development</h4>
          <p class="">Facing the shortage of charging facilities for electric vehicles (EVs), Secretary for the Environmental department, Wong Kam-sing has given a response.&nbsp;<br><br>The Government has look for suitable on-street parking spaces to install charging facilities. Ten-odd possible sites have initially been identified for such installation and their feasibility is under detailed study. However, these sites still need to be confirmed if it is suitable for installing on-street charging facilities so that the government can draw up an implementation timetable and commence a pilot scheme.&nbsp;<br><br><br>In addition, the authority also looking for suitable sites to set up public quick charging stations which is non-parking area for trial. A complete list of such is expected to be ready by the end of 2020 to facilitate the formulation of a comprehensive plan for developing a network of quick charging stations. Regarding to these two policies proposed by government, there are no detailed timetable to follow. The process of setting up the charging facilities in public area is still at an early stage.<br>&nbsp;<br>For the public charging network, Wong claimed that the Government has allocated $120 million to install additional medium chargers in government car parks that are open to the public. It is expected that over 1 000 public chargers will be added by 2022, increasing the total number of public chargers in government car parks to around 1 800. Considering there are 11080 registered electronic cars in Hong Kong, the slightly growth in the number of public chargers still cannot deal the shortage of charging facilities for electric vehicles.<br><br>The private sector has kept providing new public chargers in response to the charging demand in the market. Wong continued. However, the number of public chargers provided by the private sector has mildly increased from 536 in 2013 to 1 649 at present, climb three times in 7 years. Without government support, private sector can hardly boost the charger supply in a short time to fulfil the strong growth of electronic vehicles market.&nbsp;</p>
